## Description

To really bring all the knowledge from the first few weeks of bootcamp we needed to built something more substantial, so using 2 APIs we built this movie search website, it allows the user to get all the relevant info about a movie searching by name, the app will get the user all the info relevant to the movie and available trailers, it also allows the user to save their favorite results to they can be viewed later, we learn that bootstrap really is the best framework, also that single page webapps are a better and easier way to build apps, since we did a multipage for this project and the drawbacks showed up in obvious ways through the process but we didn't wanted to ditch it and start over so we pushed through with it 

## Usage

Upon page loading you will find a nav bar and a search bar, you can type in any movie you'd like to get info on, or navigate straight to your saved favorites

Your search results will show up like this, there's a favorite button on each result so you can save it and come back to it later

After you have saved a favorite you can use the drop down menu to get to the favorites page, or back home to start a new search

Your favorites will show up like this, you can still access the navbar
